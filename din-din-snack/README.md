# Din Din Snack

This is a snack I made for the final project in the course all developed over at [expo](https://snack.expo.io). It really made me feel more comfortable and confident and using react native and developing various parts of the app. The Design Doc that I followed for the project is listed [here at my Professor's website](https://danielgraham.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/finalprojectdoc.docx)

If I were to continue, I would flesh out the rest of the functionality beyond this to create a filly working app with a firebase backend. This is a project I may pursue in the upcoming weeks.
